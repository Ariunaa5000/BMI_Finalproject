# BMI_Finalproject
Identification and characterization of biallelic burst kinetics of Ewing sarcoma from single cell RNA-Seq
BMI5750 Final project by Ariunaa Bayanjargal and Rachel Brown. 

## 10X Genomic single cell RNA-seq of A673 parental cells
## Processing of raw scRNA-Seq data
Cellranger mkfastq - Fastq files 
FASTQC
MultiQC
Cellranger count - trim and align the read to custom A673 genome
## Calculation of transcriptional burst kinetics
Burst frequency and size calculated
Confidence intervals of parameters
Differential burst size and frequency between two alleles
A list of genes - biallelic differential bursting 
## Gene-set enrichment analysis
Genes with significant differences in two alleles in terms of bursting pattern
Characterize the genes with DAVID Bioinformatics Resources
